This project is tracked on GitHub: https://github.com/random-person-001/MagicText.git


>>> Riley: Let's move to Github.  Jetbrains makes it easy in a way Netbeans never could.
    Go to the menu VCS > Checkout from Version Control > GitHub
    Enter your login credentials
    In the box, paste:  https://github.com/random-person-001/MagicText.git
    Say yes to it being a new .idea project, accepting its numerous defaults
    When there're new changes on github, you can make them be on your computer too, by using VCS > Git > Fetch.
    When committing changes, most of the time you probably want to hover over the actual button to commit, and then select
    "commit and push"
    We should probably stop dropboxing, now that we're successfully using git.

    Then it's done!  We can version control correctly and collaborate concurrently!

I feel like we can refine the proposed-gameplay a bit.  I like exploring and sandbox games (though I doubt sandbox would
 be feasible here).  I like the idea of throwing in some puzzles, satires, and easter eggs but don't know about a
 general overlying gameplay.  I feel like some flashbacks scattered through the beginning may be a good thing to do.





>>> Jared:
What do you think of the other possible titles for our game?

"Sourcery Text"
"Alphanumeric Misadventures"

...or does "Magic Text" work well enough?


>>> Riley:
I also like Sourcery Text, although the other is also good.

I edited Window.java lines 91 and 109 with the hope of making opaque spaces, but that didn't seem to work.  Should
 opaque spaces be in Layer.setStr() or .placeStr()?

I really like how KSP does their descriptions; we should strive to do things similarly:
   "The Mk16 Parachute might be considered by some to be little more than a random stitching together of the surplus
   parts it is, in fact, made from. But the fact remains that the Mk16 has been widely accepted as a generally better
   alternative to being in freefall."

Proposed game starting:
 > A scene (of nostalgic colors) fades into the screen, with the first paragraph (2 sent.) of the story
 > The text fades to the next paragraph, possibly with a different scene, for the entire <story></story>
 > Once the story finishes, the screen fades to white and "2 Weeks Later" appears, and then it cuts to a the live level
 > You wander around without direction in a small room, and when you pick up [mana/food/a spellbook/etc], you're told
      what it is and how to use it.
 > You can then get out of the room into another controlled space, where ideally, you'd test that thing
 > At some point, I'd like a more open world, but that'd be later
 > As users accommodate to the flow of the game, things like staff upgrades, different weapons and powerups, and more
      freedom get introduced (larger levels/areas/worlds where you don't have to do things sequentially)

Cool things that could be included:
 * Different Biomes/Environments
 * Fighting yourself or a clone of yourself that wanders around and gets killed, drains useful stuff from you
 * A dungeon that claims to be dynamically generated but is always bugged/blocked so says to try again
 * Numerous H2G2 references
 * A mirror room, where you're in the middle of a bunch of identical-looking rooms as far as eye can see, and when you
       exit one, you really just reenter the same room at a corresponding door, but you'd never know
 * Old hermit that gives you advice that gets you killed, later in game seen laughing and remarking how was joking
 * I feel like doing some essential-to-reality but never included in games task, like going to the bathroom, eating,
       or sleeping should be done sometimes
 * A place where another character remarks how they can't find their way out of a maze, but from your birds-eye-view
       it is obvious.
 * You should be able to throw your staff or a book or something as a last resort, or maybe that's just how you start
        off.  I actually like that as being how you start off - throwing your spellbook at a beast because you have
        nothing else.  Then as you learn new stuff, you can be notified that you are more civilized than tossing blunt
        objects, and "can cast spells like a decent member of our society"


What do you think, Jared?

  * I actually would like to see if we could make it a bit bigger, for a more immersive experience than just a sixth
        of the screen

<possible-gameplay>


I really like the top-down perspective, so I feel as if we should go with that. So here is what I'm thinking of: (NOTE:
 the controls are best visualized on a qwerty keyboard)



The UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys control movement. Moving in a direction will set your orientation in that
 direction. Orientation doesn't change when you stop moving.  Pressing the A key will toggle locking your orientation at
 your current orientation (thus won't change if you move to somewhere else). A '+' symbol will appear adjacent to the
 player when toggled on and it is placed according to the orientation.
(The + symbol helps the player remember know they are orientation-locked and what their orientation is despite their
 movements; '@+' means oriented to the right)



Your attacks are casting spells. You can have up to two spells equipped at a time. The two spells are bound to the S and
 D key respectively. Pushing the corresponding button will cast the spell in the direction of your orientation. Some
 spells may be cast on yourself and thus doesn't utilize orientation. Shooting a fireball will.



Pushing the W key will open a menu where you can configure inventory and spells. Spells are discovered throughout your
 journey.


Spells have a cost attached to them, rather than require a cooling down period. They consume a resource called "mana."
 (A common name for magic resource) Each spell uses different amounts of mana and thus can be casted a different amount
 of times in succession.

 Not casting a spell for 2 seconds (could a have a stat modifier; could possibly be longer than 2 as a base) will quickly
 recharge your mana back to full.



Enemies that attack you will deplete a health stat. Reaching zero health or below will result in death. 
The game will
 then reset to the most recently saved state.  (A fairly standard mechanic).  

Enemies can also die.


Combat will consist of locking your orientation (aiming), and then fire spells while strafing to dodge enemy attacks or
 run from enemies with melee weapons. When the players runs out of mana, they will will then have to focus more on
 dodging and running until the mana meter refills. Throughout this cycle, the player will probably also need to change
 their orientation as new threats appear or old ones die.

Hopefully, different enemy types, environments, and spells throughout the game will keep the combat interesting enough
 to keep the player from getting bored of the somewhat inherently repetitive gameplay.
