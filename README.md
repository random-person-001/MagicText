# SourceryText
A text-based Java adventure, in collaboration with @HazilTheNut, and @zachllogan

###GENERALLY RELEVANT WORDS   

If you want to try out the latest build of the game, you can [download the .jar file](https://github.com/random-person-001/MagicText/raw/master/jarOutput/latest.jar) from the jarOutput folder (your computer will understandably ask for your affirmation before running it).

<story>
There once was a time, which was rather recent, that the world was simple. @'s were people, #'s were walls and terrain.

It was simple, and somewhat elegant too.

You couldn't have asked for anything more.


Unfortunately, someone other than you could. That scoundrel decided the world needed more than 3 characters, and
 switched the world's settings to enable the use of all characters.



Numbers, letters, and other non-alphanumeric characters flooded the world, making it complex, interesting, and also
 confusing.



You decide this wasn't a good thing. And so you embark on a wayward journey to dive into the gaping hole in the earth,
 called The Source, and switch the settings back to normal.  Most worlds are closed-source, and that just stinks. This
 world is special, however.  It is open-source. 

The Source is a giant pit in the universe that leads to the source code
 of the world and anyone in there can change anything.


The only problem is that you need a rope strong enough to survive exiting the universe and into its settings. 

Those ropes are, as it turns out, pretty scarce. They do exist though, since that guy found a way into the settings in
 the first place. Without a rope, you would fall out of the universe and never come back, or achieve anything.



And thus the quest for the wondrous rope began.
